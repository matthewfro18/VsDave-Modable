# ABOUT DEVELOPMENT 
- I feel like working on this again!
- stuff im planning to add:
- [DONE] version checker
- Events (play animations, change characters, etc)
- Compatibility with other engines
- [DONE] option pack saver (saving all the options into a json that you can put back into the game) 
- [DONE] changing camera position for characters
- [DONE] base game deleter (deletes stuff from the base game that is not needed so you have space for mods)
- maybe more things (I can't think of anything else right now)

btw suggest me stuff (btw im not that good of a coder) to add to this engine by going to the issues tab

# KNOWN BUGS
Ok weirdest thing, on some charts some notes are completely invisible and unhittable by the player. Bad thing is I have no idea how to fix this.
I think it's caused by Psych Engine charts (0.6.3 and below) so just use later versions of psych engine for charting
